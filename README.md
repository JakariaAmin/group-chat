## Vuetify or Quasar?
Vuetify will be removed in next commit, quasar will stay. As quasar's components are better, specially the list component used in chat conversation screen.

## User Interface (What is not same as WhatsApp yet)

The intention was to design the user interface as close as possible, it wasn't fully possible yet due to time constraint.

These points listed bellow will be improved in the future:

- Text input caret in chat screen.
- Page transition is not same as native app.
- Message text in CHATS screen clipped at right component's left edge instead of reaching unread count section.
